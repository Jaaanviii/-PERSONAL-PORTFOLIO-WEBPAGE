This project is my third internship assignment, where I created a fully responsive Personal Portfolio Website using core front-end web technologies. The goal of this task was to design a structured and professional portfolio webpage that showcases my personal background, technical skills, completed projects, and contact details. Through this assignment, I explored key aspects of web development including layout design, responsive UI creation, and basic interactivity.

üìò Project Overview

The personal portfolio serves as a digital resume ‚Äî it presents an overview of who I am, what I‚Äôve learned, what I‚Äôve built, and how people can reach me. It‚Äôs designed with simplicity, readability, and user experience in mind, keeping the structure clean and easy to navigate. The portfolio is ideal for sharing with recruiters, clients, or for academic use.

I built this project using HTML (for structure), CSS (for styling and layout), and optionally JavaScript (for enhancing user interaction like form validation or dynamic effects). No backend was used, as the purpose was to focus purely on the front-end skills and page design.

üí° Key Sections

1. Home
 
The landing page includes my name, a short tagline or designation, and a background image or styled header. This is the first impression users get when visiting the website.

2.About Me

This section provides a short biography ‚Äî who I am, my education background, and my professional goals. It helps visitors understand my personality and values.

3. Projects

The projects section displays my key academic or personal projects using styled cards or tiles. Each card includes the project name, a short description, and a clickable link to the live demo or GitHub repository.

4. Skills

This part lists my technical skills in frontend and backend development, programming languages, and tools I‚Äôve worked with. It can be presented in badges, progress bars, or simple text lists.

5. Contact
 
Includes a contact form with fields for name, email, and message, as well as links to my LinkedIn, GitHub, and email. It allows potential employers or collaborators to easily reach out to me.
